# Intro to Commands

While working on the **Intro to Commands** challenge, I understood that Linux commands are the basic way we interact with the system through the terminal. Commands are programs or built-in utilities that perform specific tasks when executed. Learning how to run commands properly is the foundation for all future challenges in pwn.college.

## My Solve

**Flag:**

For this challenge, I first understood that the terminal waits for input. When we type a command and press Enter, the system runs that command.After running the command, the program printed the flag.I copied
the flag and submitted it on the platform.

## What i learned
Linux commands are typed into a terminal and executed by the shell.
Always read the challenge text carefully â€” usually, it directly tells you what command to run.
This first challenge is meant to show that solving later challenges will also depend on running the right commands.
