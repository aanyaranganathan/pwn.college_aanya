#INTRO TO COMMANDS
This first challenge is about getting comfortable with the Linux terminal. Commands are the basic way we talk to the operating system. By typing them into the shell, we can tell the system what to do.

##MY SOLVE
FLAG:pwn.college{orLKKQo0r2LgBMPI9KbU0lDipcy.QX3YjM1wyN1EzNzEzW}

For this challenge, I first understood that the terminal waits for input. When we type a command and press Enter, the system runs that command.After running the command, the program printed the flag.I copied
the flag and submitted it on the platform.

##WHAT I LEARNED
Linux commands are typed into a terminal and executed by the shell.
Always read the challenge text carefully â€” usually, it directly tells you what command to run.
This first challenge is meant to show that solving later challenges will also depend on running the right commands.
