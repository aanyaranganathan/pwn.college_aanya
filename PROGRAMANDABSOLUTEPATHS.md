# PROGRAM AND ABSOLUTE PATHS
In this program, we need to execute the "run" program in challenge directory by invoking its absolute path.

## MY SOLVE
**Flag:**`pwn.college{okhrrfPFFAZUay6qUQc5i2yEEPU.QX1QTN0wyN1EzNzEzW}`

For this program, we need to invoke the absolute path to 'run' challenge program in challenge directory, which is in root directory. We do this by running '/challenge/run'. 

```
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{okhrrfPFFAZUay6qUQc5i2yEEPU.QX1QTN0wyN1EzNzEzW}
```

## WHAT I LEARNED
I learned that if we need to execute a program in another directory, we first need to invoke said directory.

## REFERENCES
None taken.
